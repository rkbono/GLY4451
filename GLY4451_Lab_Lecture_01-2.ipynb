    "Computers are essential to all modern Earth Science research.  We use them for compiling and analyzing data, preparing illustrations like maps or data plots, writing  manuscripts, and so on.  In this class, you will learn to write computer programs with special applications useful to Earth Scientists.  We will learn Python, an object-oriented programming language, and use Jupyter notebooks to write our Python programs.\n",

    "- It has many numerical, statistical and visualization packages\n",
    "- It is well supported and has lots of online documentation\n",

    "There is a lot of leeway in choosing variable names in Python, but there are some guidelines and outright rules. Here are some tips about variable names:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "2. They are case sensitive: 'a' is not the same as 'A'.\n",

    "3. There are some reserved words in Python that you may not use as your variable names because they have pre-defined meanings (for example, False or True)\n",

    "|   |    |    |    |    |\n",

    "- UPPERCASE  \n",
    "- UPPER_CASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES -\n",

    "- CapitalizedWords (or CapWords, or CamelCase -- so named because of the bumpy look of its letters). This is also sometimes known as StudlyCaps. - this is for _classes_ which we will learn about later.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Don't use this, it's ugly!\n",
    "- Capitalized_Words_With_Underscores \n",
    "\n",
    "Also, some things to avoid:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Don't use characters 'l' (lowercase letter el), 'O' (uppercase letter oh), or 'I' (uppercase letter eye) as single character variable names. These are easily confused in some fonts with '1' (one), '0' (zero), for example.  If you really want a letter 'el', use 'L'.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Don't use non-standard symbols like $^{\\circ}$ or $\\sim$.  \n",
